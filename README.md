# Music Game
- 2 players - each player logs in to their Spotify acc
- Each player makes their own playlist in the native Spotify App
- Player specifies the playlist name within the Music app
- Music app then gets songs from both playlists and combine them into one master playlist
	- Then game start 
- Game randomly chooses a song from the master playlist, randomly chooses a timestamp 
- Players are given multiple choice of song name/artist name
- The first correct answer gets the most point. any other person after, gets less points, and we continue to the next song sample
